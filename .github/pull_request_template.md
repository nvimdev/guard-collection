### Checklist (adding a new tool):

- [ ] If it's a linter it was exported in linter/init.lua
- [ ] The tool was added to the README
- [ ] I do not wish to write a test, but I can confirm that _it works on my machine_ _*OR*_ I have written corresponding tests for the tools I added. (don't worry if you didn't write a test, it's just nice to see the green check mark)
